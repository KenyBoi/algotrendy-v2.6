# Developer Onboarding Checklist

Welcome to AlgoTrendy! This checklist will help you get set up and productive quickly.

## âœ… Day 1: Environment Setup

### 1. Clone Repository & Install Prerequisites

- [ ] Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/KenyBoi/algotrendy-v2.6.git`
- [ ] Install .NET 8.0 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- [ ] Install Docker & Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- [ ] Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- [ ] (Optional) Install VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### 2. Security Tools Setup (REQUIRED) ðŸ”’

**This is mandatory for all developers:**

```bash
cd algotrendy-v2.6/file_mgmt_code
./setup-security-tools.sh
./setup-precommit-hooks.sh
```

- [ ] Security tools installed (Gitleaks + Semgrep)
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks configured
- [ ] Run first security scan: `./scan-security.sh`
- [ ] Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) policy

### 3. Environment Configuration

```bash
cd algotrendy-v2.6
cp .env.example .env
```

- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] **Never commit `.env`** to git (verify it's in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] Configure local database credentials
- [ ] (Optional) Add broker API keys for testing

### 4. Run Development Setup Script

```bash
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

This automated script will:
- [ ] Check all prerequisites
- [ ] Restore NuGet packages
- [ ] Build all projects
- [ ] Set up databases
- [ ] Run migrations
- [ ] Configure user secrets

---

## âœ… Day 1-2: Understand the Codebase

### 5. Read Core Documentation

- [ ] [README.md](README.md) - Project overview
- [ ] [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System architecture
- [ ] [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Development workflow
- [ ] [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) - Security policy
- [ ] [DOCKER_SETUP.md](DOCKER_SETUP.md) - Docker deployment

### 6. Explore the Code Structure

```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ AlgoTrendy.API          # REST API & Controllers
â”œâ”€â”€ AlgoTrendy.TradingEngine # Broker integrations & trading
â”œâ”€â”€ AlgoTrendy.Backtesting   # QuantConnect + Custom engines
â”œâ”€â”€ AlgoTrendy.DataChannels  # Market data providers
â”œâ”€â”€ AlgoTrendy.Core          # Domain models & interfaces
â””â”€â”€ AlgoTrendy.Infrastructure # Database, caching, etc.
```

- [ ] Review `AlgoTrendy.Core` - Domain models
- [ ] Explore `AlgoTrendy.API` - REST endpoints
- [ ] Understand `AlgoTrendy.TradingEngine` - Broker integrations
- [ ] Check `AlgoTrendy.Tests` - Testing structure

### 7. Run the Application

**Option A: Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Option B: Local Development**
```bash
cd backend/AlgoTrendy.API
dotnet run
```

- [ ] Application runs successfully
- [ ] Access API at http://localhost:5002
- [ ] View Swagger docs at http://localhost:5002/swagger
- [ ] QuestDB console at http://localhost:9000

### 8. Run Tests

```bash
cd backend
dotnet test
```

- [ ] All tests pass (306/407 should pass)
- [ ] Understand test structure (Unit, Integration)
- [ ] Review test coverage: 75%

---

## âœ… Week 1: Make Your First Contribution

### 9. Development Workflow

- [ ] Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-first-feature`
- [ ] Make a small change (fix typo, improve comments, etc.)
- [ ] Run security scan: `cd file_mgmt_code && ./scan-security.sh`
- [ ] Commit changes: `git commit -m "docs: Fix typo in README"`
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks will run automatically** - verify they pass
- [ ] Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/my-first-feature`
- [ ] Open a Pull Request

### 10. Coding Standards

- [ ] Follow .NET coding conventions
- [ ] Use meaningful variable names
- [ ] Write XML documentation for public APIs
- [ ] Write unit tests for new features
- [ ] Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.
- [ ] **Never commit secrets** - Pre-commit hooks will prevent this

### 11. Security Best Practices

- [ ] Always use environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Never hardcode API keys or passwords
- [ ] Use ASP.NET Core User Secrets for development:
  ```bash
  cd backend/AlgoTrendy.API
  dotnet user-secrets set "Broker:ApiKey" "your-key-here"
  ```
- [ ] Review security scan results before committing
- [ ] Report security issues via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) guidelines
