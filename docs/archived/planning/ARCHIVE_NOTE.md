### PROJECT_OVERVIEW_PLANNING_PHASE_OCT18_2025.md
- **Original Date:** October 18, 2025
- **Status at Time:** Planning Complete, Implementation Not Started
- **Why Archived:**
  - Claims implementation hasn't started (FALSE - v2.6 is production-ready)
  - Lists SQL injection as needing fixes (FALSE - already fixed in v2.5)
  - Shows 28-week timeline (FALSE - work completed much faster)
  - Phase completion percentages severely outdated
  - Contradicts current reality documented in `ai_context/CURRENT_STATE.md`

- **Historical Value:** Shows initial planning estimates and approach
- **Superseded By:**
  - `/root/AlgoTrendy_v2.6/ai_context/CURRENT_STATE.md` (accurate current state)
  - `/root/AlgoTrendy_v2.6/START_HERE.md` (project overview)
  - `/root/AlgoTrendy_v2.6/README.md` (project introduction)

## ⚠️ Important

**Do NOT use these documents for current project decisions.**

These are historical artifacts showing what was planned on October 18, 2025. The actual implementation progressed much faster and differently than originally estimated.

For current, accurate information, always refer to:
- `ai_context/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Current status
- `START_HERE.md` - Project overview and next steps
- `README.md` - Getting started guide
