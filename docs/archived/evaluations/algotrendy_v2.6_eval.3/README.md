## üîë Key Insights

### The Fundamental Difference

**Hedge Funds ask:** "Can I trade TODAY?"
- Answer: NO ‚ùå
- Reason: Backtesting not functional, better alternatives exist
- Recommendation: Use QuantConnect LEAN ($45K-$60K, 3-4 months)

**VCs ask:** "Can this be $100M+ company?"
- Answer: YES ‚úÖ
- Reason: Unique compliance moat, $12B market, exceptional unit economics
- Recommendation: Invest $4M-$6M seed, expect 15-20x return

### The Compliance Moat Paradox

**Same feature, 1,000x different valuation:**

- **Hedge Funds:** Value compliance at $10K-$30K ("nice cost savings")
- **VCs:** Value compliance at $30M-$50M ("unique moat creating winner-take-most market")

Neither is wrong - just different optimization for different outcomes.
