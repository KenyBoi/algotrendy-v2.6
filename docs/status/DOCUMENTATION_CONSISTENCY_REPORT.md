## 🔍 Key Findings

### Critical Inaccuracies Discovered

#### 1. **Broker Implementations** ❌ → ✅ CORRECTED
**Previous Documentation Claim:**
- "⏳ Bybit: v2.5 has full implementation, v2.6 missing"
- "⏳ Need to port brokers from v2.5 (40-50 hours)"

**Actual Codebase State:**
- ✅ 5 fully implemented brokers in v2.6

- ✅ Binance (564 lines)
- ✅ Bybit (602 lines)
- ✅ Interactive Brokers (391 lines)
- ✅ NinjaTrader (566 lines)
- ✅ TradeStation (629 lines)

**Impact:** Documentation was incorrectly claiming major features were missing when they were actually fully implemented.

#### 2. **Backtesting Engine** ✅ ACCURATE
**Documentation Claim:**
- "✅ COMPLETE - Enabled October 19, 2025"

**Actual Codebase State:**
- ✅ Verified - Fully implemented in `/root/AlgoTrendy_v2.6/backend/AlgoTrendy.Backtesting/`
- ✅ 8 indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ATR, Stochastic)
- ✅ 6 API endpoints

## 🚨 Remaining Inconsistencies (Low Priority)

### Files That May Need Future Updates
1. **UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md** - Shows "99% complete" instead of "100% complete"
2. **Various evaluation reports** in `algotrendy_v2.6_eval.*` directories
3. **Legacy documentation** in `legacy_reference/` (intentionally not updated)
4. **Planning documents** in `planning/` (historical, not updated)

**Priority:** Low - These are historical/reference documents
