## Usage Examples

### Training Models

```bash
cd /root/AlgoTrendy_v2.6/scripts/ml
python3 ml_trainer_advanced.py
```

### Starting ML API Server

```bash
python3 ml_api_server.py
# Server runs on http://localhost:5050
# Docs at http://localhost:5050/docs
```

### Making Predictions

**Python:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5050/predict/ensemble?strategy=weighted",
    json={
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
        "recent_candles": candles_data
    }
)
prediction = response.json()
print(f"Reversal: {prediction['is_reversal']}, Confidence: {prediction['confidence']}")
```

**cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5050/predict/ensemble?strategy=weighted" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol": "BTCUSDT", "recent_candles": [...]}'
```

### Checking Overfitting

- Max depth limit (max_depth=5)
- Early stopping (10 rounds)

### 2. LSTM Regularization

## Known Issues

1. **LSTM requires sequence data** - Currently skipped in ensemble for single predictions
   - **Workaround:** Maintain sequence buffer in production
   - **Fix:** Implement sequence buffer in next version

2. **First prediction slow** - Model loading takes ~2s
   - **Workaround:** Warm up models on server start
   - **Fix:** Implement model caching

3. **Large model files** - LSTM models can be 50-100MB
   - **Workaround:** Use .h5 compression
   - **Fix:** Model quantization/pruning
