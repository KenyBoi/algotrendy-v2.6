**Evaluation Date:** October 20, 2025
**Evaluator:** Head Software Engineer, Top-10 Hedge Fund
**Overall Score:** 68/100 (D+ Grade)
**Recommendation:** **DO NOT ACQUIRE** ‚ùå

---

## 1-Minute Overview

AlgoTrendy v2.6 is a **partially-built algorithmic trading platform** with exceptional compliance features but critical functional gaps. While it demonstrates strong architectural foundations and unique regulatory capabilities, **87% of essential trading functionality is missing** from the legacy v2.5 Python system.

**Bottom Line:** Platform is not acquisition-worthy at current state. Superior alternatives exist at lower cost.

**Required:** 50+ institutional-grade strategies
**Missing:**
- Statistical arbitrage
- Pairs trading
- Market making
- Options strategies (Iron Condor, Butterfly, Straddle)
- Multi-timeframe strategies

**Gap:** 45+ strategies needed (60-80 hours porting effort)

### 5. Limited Multi-Asset Support ‚ùå

**Current:** Crypto trading only (data available for all assets)

## Three Scenarios

### Scenario A: **PASS** ‚ùå (RECOMMENDED)

**Action:** Use QuantConnect LEAN + Build Custom Compliance Layer

**Rationale:**
- LEAN is FREE and has 10x more features
- Only missing component: Compliance (AlgoTrendy's strength)
- Build compliance layer for LEAN: $45K-$60K, 3-4 months
- **Total Cost:** $45K-$60K (63% cheaper than acquiring AlgoTrendy)
- **Total Timeline:** 3-4 months (67% faster)
- **Outcome:** Superior platform with institutional compliance

**This is the best option financially and technically.**

### Scenario B: **CONDITIONAL PASS** üü°

**Action:** Acquire if price ‚â§ $60K AND sellers provide 40h transition support

**Conditions:**
- Purchase price: $50K-$60K maximum
- Sellers provide: 40 hours transition support
- Budget commitment: $87K-$122K for completion
- Timeline acceptance: 8-12 months
- Risk acceptance: HIGH (unproven platform)

**Total Investment:** $137K-$182K
**Risk Level:** HIGH (87% incomplete)

**When to choose this:**
- Strategic value in owning compliance IP
- Prefer C# over Python architecture
- Have development resources available
- Can tolerate 8-12 month timeline

### Scenario C: **STRONG YES** ‚úÖ

**Action:** Acquire if sellers complete critical items FIRST

**Required from sellers (100-150 hours):**
- ‚úÖ Complete backtesting engine (40-50h)
- ‚úÖ Add 3 more brokers with full trading (40-50h)
- ‚úÖ Implement QuestDB caching (4-6h)
- ‚úÖ Fix 18 failing tests (8-12h)

**If completed:**
- New score: 80+/100 (from 68/100)
- New fair value: $140K-$180K
- **Offer range:** $120K-$150K

**This would make the acquisition attractive.**

## Final Recommendation

### **DO NOT ACQUIRE** at current state ‚ùå

**Primary Reasons:**
1. 87% incomplete (only 13% feature parity with v2.5)
2. No working backtesting (critical blocker for systematic trading)
3. Better alternatives exist at 63% lower cost
4. High risk, uncertain outcome
5. 8-12 month completion timeline unacceptable

### **PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE:** ‚úÖ

**Use QuantConnect LEAN + Build Compliance Layer**

**Advantages:**
- Cost: $45K-$60K (vs $137K-$182K for AlgoTrendy)
- Timeline: 3-4 months (vs 8-12 months)
- Features: 10x more (100+ strategies, 10+ brokers, proven backtesting)
- Community: 300,000 users vs 0
- Risk: LOW (proven platform) vs HIGH (unproven)

**Implementation:**
1. Use LEAN platform (FREE, open-source)
2. Build custom compliance layer ($45K-$60K, 3-4 months)
3. Integrate with existing infrastructure
4. Deploy to production

**Only Downside:** Don't own compliance IP (but compliance layer is custom-built)

### **IF ACQUIRING AlgoTrendy:**

**Maximum offer:** $60,000
**Conditions:**
- 40 hours seller transition support
- Full source code + documentation
- No warranties/representations (as-is)

**Budget:**
- Purchase: $50K-$60K
- Completion: $87K-$122K
- **Total: $137K-$182K**

**Timeline:** 8-12 months to production-ready

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Fix 18 failing tests immediately (week 1)
- Build backtesting engine (weeks 2-3)
- Add critical brokers (weeks 4-6)
- Port high-priority strategies (weeks 7-10)
- Load testing and production deployment (weeks 11-12)

---

## One-Line Summary

**"AlgoTrendy has excellent compliance features ($30K-$50K value) but is 87% incomplete. Use QuantConnect LEAN + build compliance layer instead for 63% cost savings and 67% faster timeline."**
