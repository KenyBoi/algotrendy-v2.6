<!-- SLIDE 7: HEDGE FUND - STRENGTHS -->

## Hedge Fund View: Strengths

### What AlgoTrendy Does Exceptionally Well

1. **Compliance Features (95/100)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - SEC/FINRA reporting (Form PF, 13F, CAT)
   - AML/OFAC sanctions screening
   - Trade surveillance (market manipulation detection)
   - 7-year data retention
   - **UNIQUE:** No other open-source platform has this

2. **FREE Data Infrastructure (90/100)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - $0/month vs $5K-$10K competitors
   - 300,000+ symbols
   - 99.9%+ accuracy vs Bloomberg
   - Annual savings: $61,776/year

3. **Modern Technology Stack** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

<!-- SLIDE 8: HEDGE FUND - GAPS -->

## Hedge Fund View: Critical Gaps

### Why We're Still Passing (Despite Corrections)

1. **No Working Backtesting** ‚ùå **BLOCKER**
   - Infrastructure exists but not functional
   - Cannot validate strategies
   - 40-50 hours to fix

2. **Limited Broker Coverage** üü° **IMPROVED**
   - 6 brokers vs 10+ institutional requirement
   - Missing: Alpaca, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Schwab
   - **BUT:** 6 is much better than "1" previously claimed!

3. **Insufficient Strategies** ‚ùå
   - 5 basic strategies vs 50+ needed
   - 45+ strategies in v2.5 (need porting)
   - 60-80 hours to port

4. **Timeline Still Too Long** ‚è±Ô∏è
   - **6-9 weeks to production** ‚úÖ **IMPROVED** (was: 8-12 weeks)
   - Need working platform NOW, not in 2 months

<!-- SLIDE 9: HEDGE FUND - VALUATION -->

## Hedge Fund: Valuation Analysis

### Build vs Buy Comparison

| Approach | Cost | Timeline | Result |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| **Acquire AlgoTrendy** | **$120K-$160K** ‚úÖ REVISED | 6-9 weeks | Partial platform |
| Build from Scratch | $240K-$322K | 10-14 months | Custom platform |
| **QuantConnect LEAN** | **$45K-$60K** ‚≠ê BEST | 3-4 months | Superior platform |

---

### Corrected Valuation ‚úÖ

**Previous Assessment (WRONG):**
- Fair value: $75K-$100K
- Max offer: $60K

**Corrected Assessment:**
- **Fair value: $120K-$160K** (+60% due to 6 brokers)
- **Max offer: $90K-$100K**
- **But: QuantConnect LEAN still better alternative at $45K-$60K**

---

<!-- SLIDE 10: HEDGE FUND - RECOMMENDATION -->

## Hedge Fund: Final Recommendation

### ‚ùå DO NOT ACQUIRE (Conditional Pass)

**Despite having 6 brokers (not 1), we still recommend PASS because:**

1. **Better Alternative Exists:**
   - QuantConnect LEAN: FREE + $45K-$60K compliance layer
   - 63% cheaper, 67% faster
   - 10x more features (100+ strategies, proven)

2. **Still Missing Critical Features:**
   - Backtesting not functional (BLOCKER)
   - 45+ strategies need porting
   - Timeline: 6-9 weeks (still too long for immediate needs)

3. **Risk Level: MEDIUM** (improved from HIGH)
   - 50-60% complete (vs 13% claimed)
   - But still uncertain outcome

---

### IF Acquiring: Conditions

**Max Offer:** $90K-$100K ‚úÖ **REVISED** (was: $60K)
**Conditions:**
- Complete backtesting engine FIRST (40-50h)
- Fix 18 failing tests
- 40 hours seller transition support

<!-- SLIDE 13: VC - THE UNIQUE MOAT -->

## VC View: The Defensible Moat

### 3-Way Competitive Moat

**1. Compliance IP (Primary Moat)** üè∞ **UNASSAILABLE**

- 4,574 lines of regulatory code (SEC/FINRA/AML)
- 6-12 months to replicate
- Requires rare regulatory expertise
- Legal liability if done wrong
- Ongoing compliance updates required

**Competitors would need:**
- $100K-$200K investment
- 6-12 month timeline
- Regulatory experts (scarce)
- Legal liability risk

**AlgoTrendy advantage:** Already built, tested, compliant

---

**2. FREE Data Infrastructure** üí∞ **UNBEATABLE**

- $0/month cost vs $5K-$10K competitors
- Bloomberg/Refinitiv **CANNOT** match (entire business is data sales)
- Creates 98% gross margins (world-class)
- Permanent pricing power

---

**3. Open-Core Business Model** üìà **PROVEN**

- GitLab: $15B valuation (IPO 2021)
- Elastic: $8B valuation (IPO 2018)
- MongoDB: $32B valuation (IPO 2017)
- HashiCorp: $5.4B valuation (IPO 2021)
