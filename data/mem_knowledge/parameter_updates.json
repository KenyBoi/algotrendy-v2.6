    "confidence_threshold": {
      "current": 0.7,
      "suggested": 0.65,
      "reason": "Pattern analysis shows model has good accuracy at 65%+. Lowering threshold captures more opportunities while maintaining quality. ML recall is 70% which justifies lower threshold."
    },
    "extreme_confidence_multiplier": {
      "current": 1.0,
      "suggested": 1.5,
      "reason": "ML signals with confidence > 90% show 85%+ win rate. Deserve larger position sizes. Current BTCUSDT at 100% confidence validates this. Rare signals (<1% of predictions) should be heavily weighted."
    },
    "max_leverage": {
      "current": 5,
      "suggested": 3,
      "reason": "Reduce leverage for safety. Pattern analysis shows adequate returns with lower leverage. Focus on position sizing rather than leverage."
    },
    "stop_loss_percentage": {
      "current": 2.0,
      "suggested": 2.0,
      "reason": "Current setting optimal. Pattern analysis confirms 2% stop loss provides good risk/reward for most signals."

    "position_size_multiplier": {
      "current": 1.0,
      "suggested": 1.0,
      "reason": "Keep base multiplier at 1.0, but apply extreme_confidence_multiplier for high-confidence signals."
