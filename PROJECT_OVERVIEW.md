# AlgoTrendy v2.6 - Project Overview

**Status:** Planning Complete | Implementation Not Started
**Created:** October 18, 2025
**Timeline:** ~~28 weeks~~ **→ 9-10 weeks (2.5 months)** with AI assistance 🤖 (REVISED from v2.5 at 60%)
**Budget:** ~~$88K-112K~~ **→ $29K-58K development** + $2.1K-3.0K/month ongoing (REVISED - 50% savings!)

## 🤖 AI-POWERED DEVELOPMENT ADVANTAGE

**Massive AI Resources Available:**
- ✅ OpenAI Professional Subscription (GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo)
- ✅ Claude Professional Subscription (Sonnet 4.5, Claude Code)
- ✅ GitHub Copilot Professional

**Impact on Project (REVISED based on v2.5 at 60% complete):**
- ⚡ **Speed:** 2x faster development (18-20 weeks → **9-10 weeks**)
- 💰 **Cost:** 50% reduction ($57K → **$29K-58K**) vs original $94K-120K
- 🎯 **Quality:** Higher (AI-assisted review + comprehensive tests)
- 📚 **Documentation:** Superior (AI generates detailed docs)
- 🎉 **Total Savings:** $36K-62K vs original estimate + 8-18 weeks saved

📖 **See:** `docs/ai_assisted_development_strategy.md` for complete AI workflow

---

## 🌐 IMPORTANT: V2.5 IS LIVE IN PRODUCTION!

AlgoTrendy v2.5 is **currently deployed and actively running** on:
- ✅ **Chicago VPS #1** (Primary trading node)
- ✅ **Chicago VM #2** (Backup/redundancy node)
- ✅ **CDMX VPS #3** (Geographic disaster recovery)

**This changes the migration strategy:**
- ✅ Can't take downtime (live trading)
- ✅ Blue-green deployment required (parallel v2.5 + v2.6)
- ✅ Infrastructure already exists (saves ~$250/month)
- ✅ Phase 6 completion: 45% (not 15%)

📖 **See:** `docs/existing_infrastructure.md` for deployment details

## 📊 PROJECT AT A GLANCE

**Overall v2.5 Completeness:** ~~45%~~ **→ 55-60%** (CORRECTED per TODO tracking) → **Target v2.6 Completeness:** 100%

```
Current State (v2.5):     [████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 55-60%
Target State (v2.6):      [████████████████████████████] 100%
Remaining Work:           [░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░████████████] 40-45%
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ **55-60%** of v2.6 functionality already exists in v2.5 (needs fixes/upgrades)
- 🔧 **20-25%** needs to be built from scratch (AI agents, additional data channels)
- 🔄 **15-20%** needs technology migration (Python→.NET, TimescaleDB→QuestDB, Next.js→Next.js 15)
- 🌐 **Production infrastructure** already exists (3 servers across 2 regions)

**🎉 MAJOR UPDATE:** After reviewing TODO tracking files, v2.5 is significantly more complete than initially assessed! See `docs/v2.5_actual_state_analysis.md` for detailed findings.
