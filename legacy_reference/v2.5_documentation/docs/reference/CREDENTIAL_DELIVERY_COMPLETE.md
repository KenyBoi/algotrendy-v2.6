## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### Before You Input Credentials

1. **Make sure you're in the right directory**
   ```bash
   pwd  # Should show: /root/algotrendy_v2.5
   ```

2. **Verify .gitignore is set up**
   ```bash
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Check no one is watching**
   - API keys are sensitive
   - Keep screen private during setup

4. **Backup your API key**
   - Store in password manager
   - Not in email or chat

### After Setup

1. **Verify permissions**
   ```bash
   ls -la .env  # Should show: -rw------- (600)
   ```

2. **Test connectivity**

   python3 verify_credentials.py
   ```

3. **Never commit .env**
   ```bash
   git status  # Should NOT show .env
   ```

4. **Rotate keys regularly**
   - Every 30-90 days
