# AlgoTrendy Project Instructions for Claude Code

## CRITICAL RULE: NO SAMPLE DATA
NEVER use sample/mock/fake stock data. ONLY use real stock data from actual market data sources (APIs, databases, live feeds).

This applies to:
- Ticker symbols (use real tickers like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL - never use fake ones like SAMPLE, TEST, DEMO)
- Stock prices (must come from real data sources)
- Trading volumes
- Market data of any kind
- All financial/trading data

If real data is not available, ask the user first - do not generate sample data under any circumstances.
