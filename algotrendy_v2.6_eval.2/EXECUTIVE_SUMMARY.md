## RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL ACQUISITION

### ✅ Scenario A: Strategic Accelerator (RECOMMENDED)

**Investment Structure:**
- **Acquisition:** $150K-$250K
- **Year 1 Enhancement:** $800K (team + consulting + infrastructure)
- **Total Year 1:** ~$1M
- **Time to Production:** 12-15 months

**Development Roadmap:**
1. **Q1 2026:** Multi-exchange support (Coinbase, Kraken, OKX)
2. **Q2 2026:** Risk management (VaR, stress testing, circuit breakers)
3. **Q3 2026:** Regulatory compliance (audit trails, reporting)
4. **Q4 2026:** Production hardening (HA, monitoring, performance)

**Required Team:**
- 2 Senior C# Engineers @ $200K/yr
- 1 Quant Developer @ $250K/yr
- 1 DevOps Engineer @ $180K/yr
- 1 Compliance Specialist (consultant)

**ROI Analysis:**
```
Greenfield Development:     $2.5M-$3M,   18-24 months
AlgoTrendy + Enhancement:   $1.5M-$2M,   12-15 months
                           ──────────   ─────────────
SAVINGS:                    $1M savings   6-9 months faster
```

### ❌ What NOT To Do

**DON'T:** Acquire for immediate deployment
**WHY:** Missing critical compliance, only single exchange, no production ops

**DON'T:** Pay >$500K
**WHY:** Better to build greenfield at that price point

**DON'T:** Deploy without enhancements
**WHY:** Regulatory risk, operational risk, reputational damage
