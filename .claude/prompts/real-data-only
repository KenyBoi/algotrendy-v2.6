CRITICAL REMINDER: For this AlgoTrendy project, you must NEVER use sample/mock/fake stock data under any circumstances. ONLY use real stock data from actual market data sources (APIs, databases, live feeds).

This includes:
- Ticker symbols (use real tickers like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL - never SAMPLE, TEST, DEMO)
- Stock prices (must come from real data sources)
- Trading volumes
- All financial/trading market data

If real data is not available, ask me first - do not generate sample data.
