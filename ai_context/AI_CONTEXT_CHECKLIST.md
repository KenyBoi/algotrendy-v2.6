## Readiness Assessment

**Are you ready to work on AlgoTrendy?**

```
ALL of these must be true:

‚úÖ You've read ai_context/README.md
‚úÖ You understand what AlgoTrendy is
‚úÖ You know we're on v2.6 (C# .NET 8)
‚úÖ You know 226/264 tests passing
‚úÖ You know deployment is ready
‚úÖ You know the 4 main components
‚úÖ You know Binance is only broker (currently)
‚úÖ You know Phase 7 (backtesting, more brokers) is next
‚úÖ You know where known issues are documented
‚úÖ You know how to make decisions (DECISION_TREES.md)

If any above is FALSE:
‚Üí Read the corresponding file from the list above
‚Üí Come back to this checklist
‚Üí Re-check
```

## Session Startup Procedure

**Every time a new Claude instance starts:**

1. **Read this file:** (1 min) - You are validating context
2. **If missing context:** Read files from list above (27 min)
3. **Verify checklist:** Answer all questions above
4. **Confirm readiness:** All should be ‚úÖ
5. **Review current task:** What am I working on today?
6. **Reference DECISION_TREES.md:** Find matching scenario
7. **Proceed with work:** Confident and fully contextual

---

## What NOT To Do

‚ùå **Do NOT modify v2.5**
‚Üí It's at /root/algotrendy_v2.5
‚Üí Read-only reference backup
‚Üí DO NOT TOUCH

‚ùå **Do NOT hardcode secrets**
‚Üí Use environment variables
‚Üí Or User Secrets for development
‚Üí Never in code

‚ùå **Do NOT skip Docker multi-stage build**
‚Üí It's critical for 70% image size reduction
‚Üí Final image: 245MB (vs 800MB without)

‚ùå **Do NOT deploy without testing**
‚Üí Always test locally first
‚Üí Recommend: Test in staging 24 hours

‚ùå **Do NOT ignore test failures**
‚Üí 226/264 is good (85.6%)
‚Üí But fix any new failures before deploying

---

## Session Transition Protocol

**When this session ends and next Claude starts:**

1. Save all work (commit to git)
2. Update CURRENT_STATE.md with new status
3. Update VERSION_HISTORY.md with what was done
4. If found new issues: Add to KNOWN_ISSUES_DATABASE.md
5. Commit with semantic message: `feat: X` or `fix: X`

**Next Claude will:**
1. Read CURRENT_STATE.md first (immediate context)
2. Skim VERSION_HISTORY.md (what happened)
3. Review DECISION_TREES.md (how to proceed)
4. Continue smoothly from where you left off

## Validation

‚úÖ **This checklist helps ensure:**
- No lost context between sessions
- Every AI understands the project
- Common mistakes prevented
- Quick decisions possible
- Smooth session transitions

**Checklist Status:** Active & Maintained
**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025
**Version:** 1.0 (First AI context repository)
**Review:** Before every work session

## Final Question

**Are you ready to work on AlgoTrendy with full context?**

‚òê YES - I've read all files and understand the project
‚òê NO - I need to review: _____________ (which file?)

If YES: Proceed with confidence!
