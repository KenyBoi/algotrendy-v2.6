2. `PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md` (what is AlgoTrendy)
3. `CURRENT_STATE.md` (where are we right now)
4. `ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT.md` (how it's built)
5. `KNOWN_ISSUES_DATABASE.md` (what can go wrong)
6. `DECISION_TREES.md` (how to make decisions)

**Then:** Read the full version history file for details

## ✅ What's Ready

- ✅ **Codebase:** All core features implemented (226/264 tests passing)
- ✅ **Database:** QuestDB configured, migration from TimescaleDB complete
- ✅ **API:** RESTful endpoints + SignalR real-time
- ✅ **Trading Engine:** Orders, positions, PnL, risk management
- ✅ **Data Channels:** 4 exchanges (REST polling, 60-sec intervals)
- ✅ **Strategies:** 2 MVP (Momentum, RSI) with indicators
- ✅ **Broker:** Binance testnet/production ready
- ✅ **Docker:** Multi-stage build, 245MB optimized, production-ready
- ✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive (50+ KB)
- ✅ **Testing:** 226 passing, 26 failed (fixtures), 12 skipped (credentials)

---

## ⏳ What's NOT Ready (Phase 7+)

- ✅ **Backtesting Engine** - COMPLETE (enabled October 19, 2025, fully integrated)
- ⏳ **Additional Brokers** - ⚠️ EXIST IN v2.5 (Bybit, Alpaca, OKX full, Kraken full), need porting (40-50 hours)
- ⏳ **Additional Strategies** - MACD, MFI, VWAP, moving averages, etc.
- ⏳ **Performance Optimization** - Not needed yet (meets targets)
- ⏳ **Advanced Analytics** - Portfolio metrics, reporting, dashboards
- ⏳ **Data Migration** - v2.5 market data to v2.6 QuestDB (simple, not urgent)

**NOTE:** Major modules from v2.5 (backtesting, brokers) were not included in v2.6 rewrite. Reference implementation exists in `/root/algotrendy_v2.5`. See `MISSING_MODULES_DISCOVERY.md` for details.

---

## 🔴 Critical Things NOT To Do

- ❌ **Never modify v2.5** - It's a complete backup/reference
- ❌ **Never hardcode secrets** - Use environment variables or User Secrets
- ❌ **Never skip Docker multi-stage build** - Keeps image 70% smaller
- ❌ **Never commit credentials** - Even test credentials
- ❌ **Never deploy without testing** - Always test locally first
- ❌ **Never run integration tests without credentials provisioned** - They will be skipped

## 🎯 Common Questions

**Q: Should I deploy v2.6 to production now?**
A: Yes, it's production-ready. Follow DEPLOYMENT_DOCKER.md. Recommend testing in staging first.

**Q: Can I trade real money yet?**
A: Only on Binance, and only if you set `BINANCE_USE_TESTNET=false`. Recommend testnet first. Bybit/OKX/Kraken not integrated yet.

**Q: Where do I add new features?**
A: Follow ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT.md. New strategies go in AlgoTrendy.Strategies/, new brokers in AlgoTrendy.TradingEngine/Brokers/, etc.

**Q: How do I run tests?**
A: `dotnet test` from project root. Some integration tests need BINANCE_API_KEY + BINANCE_API_SECRET in .env or User Secrets.

**Q: What's the performance like?**
A: Response time: <15ms warm requests. Throughput: >800 req/sec. Memory: ~140-200MB. 15-20% faster than v2.5 Python.

**Q: How do I deploy?**
A: Three steps:
  1. Set up credentials in `.env` (BINANCE_API_KEY, etc.)
  2. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
  3. Verify at `https://algotrendy.duckdns.org/health`
