## ⏳ What's NOT Ready (Phase 8+)

- ⏳ **Trading Brokers for OKX/Coinbase/Kraken** - Data channels exist, need trading capability (8-12 hours each)
- ⏳ **Additional Strategies** - MACD, MFI, VWAP, moving averages, etc. (12-20 hours)
- ⏳ **Advanced Analytics** - Portfolio metrics, reporting, dashboards (20+ hours)
- ⏳ **Web UI Dashboard** - React/Next.js frontend (30+ hours)
- ⏳ **Data Migration** - v2.5 market data to v2.6 QuestDB (simple, not urgent, 1-2 hours)

**NOTE:** All major Phase 7 features complete! FREE tier data, ML predictions, and TradingView integration operational. Legacy v2.5 exists in `/root/algotrendy_v2.5` as reference only.

---

## 🔴 Critical Things NOT To Do

- ❌ **Never modify v2.5** - It's a complete backup/reference
- ❌ **Never hardcode secrets** - Use environment variables or User Secrets
- ❌ **Never skip Docker multi-stage build** - Keeps image 70% smaller
- ❌ **Never commit credentials** - Even test credentials
- ❌ **Never deploy without testing** - Always test locally first
- ❌ **Never run integration tests without credentials provisioned** - They will be skipped

## 🎯 Common Questions

**Q: Should I deploy v2.6 to production now?**
A: Yes, it's production-ready. Follow DEPLOYMENT_DOCKER.md. Recommend testing in staging first.

**Q: Can I trade real money yet?**
A: Only on Binance, and only if you set `BINANCE_USE_TESTNET=false`. Recommend testnet first. Bybit/OKX/Kraken not integrated yet.

**Q: Where do I add new features?**
A: Follow ARCHITECTURE_SNAPSHOT.md. New strategies go in AlgoTrendy.Strategies/, new brokers in AlgoTrendy.TradingEngine/Brokers/, etc.

**Q: How do I run tests?**
A: `dotnet test` from project root. Some integration tests need BINANCE_API_KEY + BINANCE_API_SECRET in .env or User Secrets.

**Q: What's the performance like?**
A: Response time: <15ms warm requests. Throughput: >800 req/sec. Memory: ~140-200MB. 15-20% faster than v2.5 Python.

**Q: How do I deploy?**
A: Three steps:
  1. Set up credentials in `.env` (BINANCE_API_KEY, etc.)
  2. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
  3. Verify at `https://algotrendy.duckdns.org/health`
