## 🎯 Recent Fixes (October 19, 2025)

### Issue Fixed: BinanceBroker Initialization Failure

**Problem:**
- 4 BinanceBrokerTests were failing with `TypeLoadException`
- Error: "Method 'FormatSymbol' in type 'BinanceRestClientGeneralApi' does not have an implementation"
- Root cause: Binance.Net library initialization in constructor causing issues in unit tests

**Solution:**
1. **Upgraded Dependencies:**
   - Binance.Net: 10.0.0 → 10.1.0
   - Added CryptoExchange.Net 9.10.0 explicitly

2. **Implemented Lazy Initialization:**
   - Changed `BinanceBroker` to lazy-initialize the REST client
   - Moved client creation from constructor to `GetClient()` method
   - Only initializes when actually needed (during Connect or API calls)
   - Improves testability and reduces constructor overhead

**Results:**
- ✅ All 4 failing tests now pass
- ✅ All 6 BinanceBrokerTests pass
- ✅ All 306 unit tests pass
- ✅ 0 test failures in unit test suite

- ✅ Well-organized (by component and purpose)
- ✅ Good coverage (80%+ on core modules)

### Code Quality
- ✅ FluentAssertions for readable test assertions
- ✅ Moq for dependency mocking
- ✅ Test builders for complex object creation
- ✅ Proper async/await usage
- ✅ Theory tests for parameterized scenarios

## 🔧 Running Tests

### Run All Unit Tests
```bash
dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration" --configuration Release
```

### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~BinanceBrokerTests"
```

### Run Tests with Coverage
```bash
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./coverage
```

### Run Integration Tests (requires credentials)
```bash
# Set credentials first
export BINANCE_API_KEY=your_key
export BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_secret

# Run all tests
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

### Run Tests in CI/CD
```bash
# GitHub Actions workflow already configured
# See: .github/workflows/dotnet-build-test.yml
```

## 📝 Known Test Patterns

### Integration Test Credential Handling
Integration tests check for credentials in constructor:

```csharp
public BybitBrokerIntegrationTests(ITestOutputHelper output)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("BYBIT_API_KEY")))
    {
        throw new SkipException("Bybit API credentials not configured.");
    }
}
```

**Issue:** XUnit treats constructor exceptions as failures, not skips.

**Workaround:** Run with `--filter "Category!=Integration"` to exclude these tests.

**Future Fix:** Convert to Fact(Skip=...) based on runtime credential check.

## 🔍 Test Debugging

### Failed Test Troubleshooting

```bash
# Get detailed error output

# Run with diagnostic logging
dotnet test --diag:log.txt
