# AlgoTrendy Migration Plan: v2.6 → v3.0

**Following:** Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0) + Git Flow Standards
**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Current State:** v2.6 (monolith) on main, v3.0.0-beta (modular) on modular
**Goal:** Make v3.0 the new production, preserve v2.6 as legacy

## 📚 Industry Standards Reference

### Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0)
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE+BUILD

v3.0.0         ← Stable release
v3.0.0-beta.1  ← Pre-release (beta)
v3.0.0-rc.1    ← Release candidate
v3.1.0         ← Minor update (new features)
v3.0.1         ← Patch (bug fixes)
```

### Git Flow Branch Naming
```
main/master          ← Production code
develop              ← Integration branch
feature/xxx          ← New features
release/x.x.x        ← Release preparation
hotfix/xxx           ← Production hotfixes
support/x.x          ← Long-term support (LTS)
legacy/vX.X          ← Archived old versions
```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Naming Structure

### Branch Strategy
```
main                 ← v3.0.0+ (NEW production - modular architecture)
legacy/v2.6          ← v2.6.x (OLD production - monolith, frozen)
develop              ← Future v3.1.0+ development
release/v3.0.0       ← v3.0.0 release candidate (temporary)
```

### Version Tags
```
# Legacy versions (frozen)
v2.6.0               ← Final v2.6 monolith release
v2.6-lts             ← Long-term support marker

# Current versions
v3.0.0               ← First stable modular release
v3.0.1               ← Patch releases
v3.1.0               ← Future feature releases

# Support branches
support/v2.6         ← Critical security fixes only (optional)
```

---

## 🚀 Migration Steps (Production-Ready Approach)

### Step 1: Preserve v2.6 as Legacy (Create safety net)

```bash
# Ensure you're on latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create legacy branch (frozen state)
git checkout -b legacy/v2.6
git push origin legacy/v2.6

# Create LTS tag for v2.6
git tag -a v2.6.0 -m "AlgoTrendy v2.6.0 - Final Monolith Release (LTS)

This is the last release of the v2.6 monolith architecture.

Features:
- 7 brokers (Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, IB, NinjaTrader, TradeStation, MEXC)
- QuantConnect integration
- Custom backtest engine
- 98/100 production readiness

Status: FROZEN - Use legacy/v2.6 branch for historical reference
LTS: Critical security fixes only (until Dec 2026)
Migration: See MIGRATION_TO_V3_PLAN.md for v3.0 upgrade

Superseded by: v3.0.0 (modular architecture)
"

git tag -a v2.6-lts -m "AlgoTrendy v2.6 LTS - Long Term Support marker

Security fixes only until December 2026.
Feature development frozen.
Use v3.0+ for new deployments."

# Push tags
git push origin v2.6.0 v2.6-lts
```

### Step 2: Promote modular → main (Make v3.0 production)

```bash
# Backup current main (extra safety)
git checkout main
git tag v2.6-final-backup

# Option A: Fast-forward merge (if no conflicts)
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only modular
# If this fails, use Option B

# Option B: Replace main with modular (clean replacement)
git checkout modular
git branch -D main  # Delete local main
git checkout -b main  # Create new main from modular
git push origin main --force-with-lease  # Force push (safe)
```

### Step 3: Graduate v3.0.0-beta → v3.0.0 stable

```bash
# On new main branch
git checkout main

# Remove beta tag (keep for history)
# git push --delete origin v3.0.0-beta  # Optional: remove beta from remote

# Create stable v3.0.0 release
git tag -a v3.0.0 -m "AlgoTrendy v3.0.0 - Dual Architecture Release

🎉 MAJOR RELEASE: Modular architecture now production-ready!

## 🏗️ Architecture

- Full backwards compatibility with v2.6 data

## ✨ What's New
- 🔧 Microservices architecture (4 independent services)
- 🏦 11 brokers (added: Alpaca, Freqtrade, Kraken, MEXC)
- 🤖 MEM AI enhancements (100+ new features)
- 🧠 ML system: XGBoost + LSTM hybrid (78% accuracy)
- 📊 Freqtrade integration (multi-bot monitoring)
- 🌍 Multi-region deployment support
- 📖 20-page deployment comparison guide

## 📊 Stats

- Zero data migration required

## 🚀 Quick Start

Monolith (Simple):
\`\`\`bash
git checkout legacy/v2.6  # OR main (supports both)
docker-compose up -d
\`\`\`

Microservices (Scalable):
\`\`\`bash
git checkout main
docker-compose -f docker-compose.modular.yml up -d
\`\`\`

## 📖 Documentation

git push origin v3.0.0
```

### Step 4: Update Repository Settings (GitHub)

```bash
# Set default branch to main (v3.0)
# Via GitHub UI:
# Settings → Branches → Default branch → main

# Update branch protection rules:
# - Protect main (require PR reviews)
# - Protect legacy/v2.6 (prevent force push)
```

### Step 5: Update Documentation

```bash
# Update README.md badges
# Update version references from v2.6 to v3.0
# Update quick start to reference v3.0

git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: Update version references to v3.0.0"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Aspect | Old (v2.6) | New (v3.0) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Branch** | main (pre-migration) | main (post-migration) |
| **Tag** | v2.6.0 | v3.0.0 |
| **Architecture** | Monolith only | Dual (monolith + microservices) |
| **Brokers** | 7 | 11 (+Alpaca, Freqtrade, Kraken, MEXC) |
| **Deployment** | docker-compose.yml | Both docker-compose files |
| **Status** | Frozen (LTS) | Active development |
| **Support** | Security only (2 years) | Full support |

---

## 🔐 Rollback Plan (If needed)

If v3.0 has issues, rollback is simple:

```bash
# Revert main to v2.6
git checkout main
git reset --hard v2.6.0
git push origin main --force-with-lease

# Or restore from legacy branch
git checkout legacy/v2.6
git branch -D main
git checkout -b main
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

**Data Safety:** No data migration occurs, so rollback is risk-free.

---

## 📖 Industry Best Practices Applied

✅ **Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0)**
- MAJOR bump (2.6 → 3.0) due to architectural change
- Properly formatted tags (vX.Y.Z)

✅ **Git Flow**
- main = production
- develop = integration
- legacy/* = archived versions

✅ **Long-Term Support (LTS)**
- v2.6-lts tag for clarity
- 2-year security support commitment

✅ **Zero-Downtime Migration**
- No data migration required
- Users can choose architecture
- Gradual rollout possible

✅ **Safety First**
- Multiple backups (legacy/v2.6, v2.6.0 tag, v2.6-final-backup)
- Force-with-lease (prevents accidental overwrites)
- Clear rollback procedure

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Approach 1: Conservative (Recommended)
1. Keep both main (v3.0) and legacy/v2.6
2. Tag v2.6.0 and v2.6-lts
3. Promote modular → main as v3.0.0
4. Run both in parallel for 1-2 weeks
5. Fully deprecate v2.6 after validation

### Approach 2: Aggressive
1. Immediately replace main with modular
2. Delete old main (after backup to legacy/v2.6)
3. Tag v3.0.0 and deploy
4. No parallel running period

**Recommended:** Approach 1 (safer, allows gradual transition)

---

## 🏁 Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:
- ✅ legacy/v2.6 branch exists and is frozen
- ✅ v2.6.0 and v2.6-lts tags created
- ✅ main branch = modular branch code
- ✅ v3.0.0 stable tag created
- ✅ GitHub default branch = main (v3.0)
- ✅ README.md references v3.0.0
- ✅ Both architectures deployable
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Rollback plan tested
