## v2.5 Performance Baseline (Reference)

### Sequential Request Performance (v2.5)

```
Request #1 (Cold):
  • DNS Lookup:      70.8 ms
  • TCP Connect:     71.0 ms
  • TLS Handshake:   84.1 ms
  • TTFB:            86.1 ms
  • Total:           86.2 ms

Request #2-5 (Cached/Warm):
  • DNS Lookup:      0.7 ms (cached)
  • TCP Connect:     0.8 ms (reused)
  • TLS Handshake:   13.0 ms (session reused)
  • TTFB:            14.8 ms
  • Total:           15.2 ms ← AVERAGE
```

**v2.5 Findings:**
✅ First request: 86ms (acceptable, includes DNS+TCP+TLS setup)
✅ Subsequent requests: ~15ms average (excellent)
✅ Performance improvement: 5.7x faster after warm-up
✅ Consistent: All warm requests within 14.4-15.6ms range

## v2.6 Performance Expectations

### Why v2.6 Should Be Faster

**1. Language & Runtime:**
- C# async/await: Native true parallelism (no GIL like Python)
- .NET 8: Optimized JIT compilation
- Expected improvement: 15-20% faster request handling

**2. Architecture:**
- Docker containerization: Optimized startup
- Async-first design throughout
- Minimal framework overhead (vs Flask)
- Expected improvement: 10-15% faster

**3. Data Access:**
- QuestDB: Purpose-built for time-series (vs TimescaleDB)
- Connection pooling: Optimized for .NET
- Batch operations: Async-friendly
- Expected improvement: 20-30% for data operations

**4. Overall Expected Performance:**
```
v2.5 Python Flask:     15.2 ms (warm request)
v2.6 C# .NET 8:        12.0 ms (expected warm request)
─────────────────────────────────
Improvement:           3.2 ms (21% faster)
```

## v2.6 Testing Roadmap

### Pre-Deployment Benchmarks (TODO)

**When deploying v2.6, run these tests:**

```bash
# 1. API Endpoint Performance
cd /root/AlgoTrendy_v2.6
curl -w "Connect: %{time_connect}ms, TTFB: %{time_starttransfer}ms, Total: %{time_total}ms\n" \
  -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:5002/health

# 2. Market Data Endpoint
curl -w "Total: %{time_total}ms\n" -o /dev/null -s \
  http://localhost:5002/api/market-data/binance/btcusdt

# 3. Concurrent Load (10 requests)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:5002/health &
done
wait

# 4. Database Query Performance
# Query QuestDB directly
curl -G "http://localhost:9000" \
  --data-urlencode "query=SELECT COUNT(*) FROM market_data;"
```

### Expected v2.6 Metrics

| Endpoint | Expected Time | Test Command |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `/health` | <5ms | `curl http://localhost:5002/health` |
| `/api/market-data/binance/btcusdt` | <50ms | See above |
| Concurrent (10 requests) | <15ms total | See above |
| Database insert (1000 records) | <100ms | QuestDB query |

## Performance Optimization Features Built Into v2.6

### ✅ Caching Layer
- **MemoryCache** for indicator calculations (1-minute TTL)
- Reduces repeated computations for same market data
- Expected improvement: 30-50% for repeated analysis

### ✅ Connection Pooling
- HTTP client factory with connection pooling
- QuestDB connection pooling via Npgsql
- Reuses connections for subsequent requests
- Expected improvement: 10-20% for sequential requests

### ✅ Batch Operations
- Market data batch inserts to QuestDB
- Reduces transaction overhead
- Expected improvement: 25-40% for data ingestion

### ✅ Async/Await Throughout
- All I/O operations non-blocking
- Multiple concurrent requests handled efficiently
- Expected improvement: 15-25% for concurrent load

### ✅ Docker Optimization
- Multi-stage build (reduces final image)
- Layer caching (faster rebuilds)
- Non-root user (security + performance)
- Resource limits (predictable performance)

## Deployment Performance Validation

### Post-Deployment Checklist

After deploying v2.6, validate:

- [ ] API responds to `/health` within 10ms (warm)
- [ ] Market data endpoint responds within 50ms
- [ ] Concurrent 10 requests complete in <20ms
- [ ] Database queries complete in <100ms
- [ ] No memory leaks after 1 hour operation
- [ ] CPU usage <10% at idle, <50% under load
- [ ] Docker container startup <45 seconds

### Performance Regression Detection

If performance degrades:

```bash
# 1. Check resource usage
docker stats

# 2. Check application logs
docker-compose logs api | grep -i "error\|warn"

# 3. Check database health
docker-compose logs questdb

# 4. Restart if needed
docker-compose restart api
```
