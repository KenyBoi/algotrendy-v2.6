# AlgoTrendy v2.6 - Firewall Configuration Status

**Generated:** October 19, 2025
**Firewall:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
**Status:** ✅ Active and Properly Configured

---

## Current Firewall Status

```
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default Policy:
  - Incoming: deny (secure)
  - Outgoing: allow
  - Routed: deny
```

---

## Configured Rules

### Required for AlgoTrendy Deployment ✅

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Status | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|------|----------|---------|--------|------|------|
| **22** | TCP | SSH Access | ✅ Allowed | Yes | Yes |
| **80** | TCP | HTTP (redirects to HTTPS) | ✅ Allowed | Yes | Yes |
| **443** | TCP | HTTPS (API & Web Interface) | ✅ Allowed | Yes | Yes |

### Additional Rules Present

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **80** | UDP | HTTP/3 QUIC (optional) | ✅ Allowed | Not required but safe |
| **443** | UDP | HTTPS/QUIC (optional) | ✅ Allowed | Not required but safe |
| **3000** | TCP | Development frontend | ⚠️ Allowed | Consider removing for production |

---

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Default Deny Policy** - All incoming connections denied by default (secure)
2. **Core Ports Configured** - SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) all properly allowed
3. **Logging Enabled** - Firewall activity is being logged
4. **IPv6 Support** - Rules configured for both IPv4 and IPv6

### ⚠️ Recommendations for Production

1. **Port 3000 (Development Frontend)**
   - **Current:** Open to all connections
   - **Recommendation:** Close this port in production
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     sudo ufw delete allow 3000/tcp
     ```
   - **Reason:** Port 3000 is typically used for development React/Next.js frontend. In production, the frontend should be served through Nginx on port 443.

2. **SSH Port 22 Hardening**
   - **Current:** SSH allowed from anywhere
   - **Recommendation:** Restrict SSH to specific IP addresses (if known)
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     # Remove current rule
     sudo ufw delete allow 22/tcp

     # Add restricted rule (replace with your IP)
     sudo ufw allow from YOUR_IP_ADDRESS to any port 22 proto tcp
     ```
   - **Reason:** Reduces attack surface by limiting SSH access

3. **Rate Limiting on SSH**
   - **Recommendation:** Enable rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     sudo ufw limit 22/tcp
     ```
   - **Reason:** Limits connection attempts to prevent password guessing

## Production Firewall Configuration

### Recommended Production Setup

```bash
# Reset UFW to defaults (CAREFUL - only if you have console access)
# sudo ufw --force reset

# Set default policies
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny routed

# Allow SSH with rate limiting (from specific IP if known)
sudo ufw limit 22/tcp
# OR restrict to specific IP:
# sudo ufw allow from YOUR_OFFICE_IP to any port 22 proto tcp

# Allow HTTP (for Let's Encrypt validation and redirect to HTTPS)
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

# Allow HTTPS (main application access)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Remove development port 3000
sudo ufw delete allow 3000/tcp

# Enable logging
sudo ufw logging on

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

## Internal Docker Network Ports

The following ports are used internally by Docker containers but **NOT exposed** to the host:

| Port | Service | Accessibility |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 8812 | QuestDB PostgreSQL Wire | `127.0.0.1` only (local) |
| 9000 | QuestDB Web Console | `127.0.0.1` only (local) |
| 5002 | AlgoTrendy API | Internal to Docker network |

These ports are protected by:
1. Docker network isolation
2. Bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) in docker-compose.prod.yml
3. Not accessible from external networks

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status verbose

# Check numbered rules (for deletion)
sudo ufw status numbered

# View recent firewall logs
sudo tail -50 /var/log/ufw.log

# Check which processes are listening on which ports
sudo ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# Test external connectivity (from another machine)
# nmap -p 22,80,443 YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

## Current Status: Deployment Ready

✅ **Firewall Configuration:** READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The firewall is properly configured for AlgoTrendy deployment with:
- Essential ports (22, 80, 443) open
- Secure default deny policy
- Logging enabled
- IPv4 and IPv6 support

**Optional improvement before production:**
- Close port 3000/tcp (development only)
- Add SSH rate limiting or IP restriction

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Firewall configured** - No action required for basic deployment
2. ⚠️ **Optional:** Apply production hardening recommendations above
3. ⏭️ **Proceed to:** Item 5 - Consider Let's Encrypt for production SSL

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment
**Maintainer:** Run `sudo ufw status` periodically to verify rules remain active
