# AlgoTrendy v2.6 - Firewall Configuration Status

**Generated:** October 19, 2025
**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025 (Production Hardening Applied)
**Firewall:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Active and Production-Hardened

---

## Current Firewall Status

```
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default Policy:
  - Incoming: deny (secure)
  - Outgoing: allow
  - Routed: deny
```

---

## Configured Rules

### Required for AlgoTrendy Deployment ‚úÖ

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Status | IPv4 | IPv6 | Security |
|------|----------|---------|--------|------|------|----------|
| **22** | TCP | SSH Access | ‚úÖ **LIMIT** | Yes | Yes | üîí Rate-limited (max 6 conn/30s) |
| **80** | TCP | HTTP (redirects to HTTPS) | ‚úÖ Allowed | Yes | Yes | Standard |
| **443** | TCP | HTTPS (API & Web Interface) | ‚úÖ Allowed | Yes | Yes | Standard |

### Additional Rules Present

| Port | Protocol | Purpose | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **80** | UDP | HTTP/3 QUIC (optional) | ‚úÖ Allowed | Not required but safe |
| **443** | UDP | HTTPS/QUIC (optional) | ‚úÖ Allowed | Not required but safe |
| **3000** | TCP | Development frontend | ‚úÖ **REMOVED** | Production hardening applied |

## Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths (Production-Hardened Configuration)

1. **Default Deny Policy** - All incoming connections denied by default (secure)
2. **Core Ports Configured** - SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) all properly allowed
3. **SSH Rate Limiting ACTIVE** üîí - Prevents brute force attacks (max 6 connections per 30 seconds)
4. **Development Ports Removed** - Port 3000 closed for production security
5. **Logging Enabled** - Firewall activity is being logged
6. **IPv6 Support** - Rules configured for both IPv4 and IPv6

### ‚úÖ Production Hardening Applied

1. **Port 3000 (Development Frontend)** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Status:** REMOVED from firewall rules
   - **Applied:** `sudo ufw delete allow 3000/tcp`
   - **Result:** Port 3000 no longer accessible from external networks
   - **Security Impact:** Reduced attack surface, development services not exposed

2. **SSH Rate Limiting** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - **Status:** ACTIVE
   - **Applied:** `sudo ufw limit 22/tcp`
   - **Result:** SSH connections limited to 6 attempts per 30 seconds per IP
   - **Security Impact:** Brute force SSH attacks significantly mitigated

### üîê Additional Optional Hardening (If Needed)

1. **SSH IP Restriction** (Optional - if static IP available)
   - **Recommendation:** Restrict SSH to specific IP addresses
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     # Remove current rule
     sudo ufw delete limit 22/tcp

     # Add IP-restricted rule (replace with your IP)
     sudo ufw allow from YOUR_IP_ADDRESS to any port 22 proto tcp
     ```
   - **Benefit:** Complete elimination of SSH attacks from unauthorized IPs
   - **Drawback:** Cannot access SSH if your IP changes

---

## Production Firewall Configuration

### Recommended Production Setup

```bash
# Reset UFW to defaults (CAREFUL - only if you have console access)
# sudo ufw --force reset

# Set default policies
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny routed

# Allow SSH with rate limiting (from specific IP if known)
sudo ufw limit 22/tcp
# OR restrict to specific IP:
# sudo ufw allow from YOUR_OFFICE_IP to any port 22 proto tcp

# Allow HTTP (for Let's Encrypt validation and redirect to HTTPS)
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp

# Allow HTTPS (main application access)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Remove development port 3000
sudo ufw delete allow 3000/tcp

# Enable logging
sudo ufw logging on

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

## Internal Docker Network Ports

The following ports are used internally by Docker containers but **NOT exposed** to the host:

| Port | Service | Accessibility |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 8812 | QuestDB PostgreSQL Wire | `127.0.0.1` only (local) |
| 9000 | QuestDB Web Console | `127.0.0.1` only (local) |
| 5002 | AlgoTrendy API | Internal to Docker network |

These ports are protected by:
1. Docker network isolation
2. Bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) in docker-compose.prod.yml
3. Not accessible from external networks

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check firewall status
sudo ufw status verbose

# Check numbered rules (for deletion)
sudo ufw status numbered

# View recent firewall logs
sudo tail -50 /var/log/ufw.log

# Check which processes are listening on which ports
sudo ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN

# Test external connectivity (from another machine)
# nmap -p 22,80,443 YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

## Current Status: Production-Hardened and Deployment Ready

‚úÖ **Firewall Configuration:** PRODUCTION-HARDENED AND READY

The firewall has been fully hardened for production AlgoTrendy deployment:
- ‚úÖ Essential ports (22, 80, 443) configured with optimal security
- ‚úÖ SSH rate limiting active (6 connections/30s per IP)
- ‚úÖ Development port 3000 removed
- ‚úÖ Secure default deny policy
- ‚úÖ Logging enabled
- ‚úÖ IPv4 and IPv6 support

**Production Hardening Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Port 3000/tcp removed (development only)
- ‚úÖ SSH rate limiting enabled
- ‚úÖ Attack surface minimized

## Applied Hardening Summary

| Hardening Item | Status | Command Used | Security Benefit |
|----------------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Remove dev port 3000 | ‚úÖ Done | `sudo ufw delete allow 3000/tcp` | Closes development frontend port |
| SSH rate limiting | ‚úÖ Done | `sudo ufw limit 22/tcp` | Prevents brute force (6 conn/30s) |

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Firewall configured and hardened** - Production-ready
2. ‚úÖ **Production hardening applied** - All recommendations implemented
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è **Proceed to:** Item 5 - Consider Let's Encrypt for production SSL

**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025 (Production Hardening Applied)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Production-hardened and ready for deployment
**Maintainer:** Run `sudo ufw status` periodically to verify rules remain active
