## üí° Key Insights from Research

### What Actually Works (Research-Backed):
1. **Ensemble Models** > Single models (15-25% accuracy improvement)
2. **CPCV** > Walk-forward for overfitting prevention
3. **Price Features** (60%+ importance) > Traditional indicators (14-15%)
4. **Multi-timeframe** integration improves stability
5. **Boruta feature selection** + CNN-LSTM = 82.44% accuracy

### Critical Warnings:
- **HFT Study**: R¬≤ dropped from 0.75 to **NEGATIVE** out-of-sample
