# ⚠️ LEVERAGED TRADING GUIDE (25x)

**CRITICAL WARNING**: 25x leverage multiplies BOTH gains AND losses by 25x

---

## 🚨 Leverage Risk Overview

### What 25x Leverage Means

**Without Leverage (Current)**:
- $10,000 capital
- 5% position size = $500 per trade
- 2% return = **+$200 profit**
- 4% adverse move = **-$400 loss** (still have $9,600)

**With 25x Leverage**:
- $10,000 capital
- 5% position size × 25x = **$12,500 per trade**
- 2% return = **+$5,000 profit** (50% account gain!)
- **4% adverse move = LIQUIDATION** (lose everything)

### Liquidation Risk

With 25x leverage, you get liquidated if price moves **4% against you**:

| Leverage | Liquidation Distance |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1x (no leverage) | Never (just lose position) |
| 5x | 20% adverse move |
| 10x | 10% adverse move |
| 25x | **4% adverse move** ⚠️ |
| 50x | 2% adverse move |

**With 25x leverage, a 4% move wipes out your entire account.**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL Risk Management for 25x Leverage

### Absolutely Required Safety Measures

#### 1. **Smaller Position Sizes**

**DO NOT use 5% positions with 25x leverage!**

Recommended position sizes:
- **Conservative**: 1% of capital (= 25% leveraged exposure)
- **Moderate**: 2% of capital (= 50% leveraged exposure)
- **Aggressive**: 3% of capital (= 75% leveraged exposure)
- **NEVER**: >4% of capital (= 100% leveraged = instant wipeout risk)

**Example with $10,000**:
```
1% position = $100 unleveraged
× 25x leverage = $2,500 position
4% adverse move = -$100 (1% account loss, safe)

vs

5% position = $500 unleveraged
× 25x leverage = $12,500 position
4% adverse move = -$500 (5% account loss, DANGEROUS)
```

#### 2. **Tighter Stop Losses**

**Current stops**: 2-4% of entry price
**Leveraged stops**: **MAX 2% of entry price**

With 25x leverage:
- 2% stop = 50% account loss if hit
- 3% stop = 75% account loss if hit
- 4% stop = 100% account loss (liquidation)

**Recommended**:
- Stop loss: 1.5% of entry price (37.5% account risk)
- Absolute max: 2% of entry price (50% account risk)

#### 3. **Daily Loss Limits**

**MANDATORY**: Stop trading if you lose:
- **2% of account in one day** (= -$200 on $10k)
- **5% of account in one week** (= -$500 on $10k)
- **10% of account in one month** (= -$1,000 on $10k)

#### 4. **Trade Frequency Limits**

- **Max 1 trade per day**
- **Max 3 trades per week**
- If 2 losses in a row → STOP for 24 hours

## 📈 Recommended Leveraged Configuration

### Conservative (Recommended for 25x)

```python
FilterConfig(
    min_confidence=0.75,      # Higher threshold (75% vs 72%)
    min_movement_pct=6.0,     # Larger moves only (6% vs 5%)
    use_roc_filter=True,      # Add momentum filter
)

# Position sizing
position_size_pct = 0.01      # 1% of capital (vs 5%)
max_daily_trades = 1
stop_loss_pct = 0.015         # 1.5% (vs 2-4%)
```

**Expected Performance**:
- 5-8 trades/month (very selective)
- 85%+ win rate
- +15-25% monthly return
- Lower risk of wipeout

### Aggressive (High Risk)

```python
FilterConfig(
    min_confidence=0.72,      # Standard threshold
    min_movement_pct=5.0,     # Standard movement
)

# Position sizing
position_size_pct = 0.03      # 3% of capital
max_daily_trades = 2
stop_loss_pct = 0.02          # 2%
```

**Expected Performance**:
- 10-15 trades/month
- 85-90% win rate
- +40-60% monthly return
- **HIGH risk of wipeout**

## 💀 Liquidation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Bad Trade

**Setup**:
- Capital: $10,000
- Position: 3% = $300 unleveraged
- Leveraged: $300 × 25 = $7,500
- Entry: $65,000 BTC

**What Happens**:
- Price moves against you: -4%
- BTC drops to $62,400
- Loss: $7,500 × 4% = -$300
- **Account wiped to $9,700** ⚠️

**With tight stop at 2%**:
- Stop hit at $63,700
- Loss: $7,500 × 2% = -$150
- Account: $9,850 (survived)

### Scenario 2: Stop Loss Failure

**Setup**:
- Flash crash / gap down
- Price gaps past your stop loss
- You get liquidated instead

**What Happens**:
- Stop loss set at -2%
- Price gaps down -5% (flash crash)
- Liquidated at -4%
- **Entire account lost**

**Protection**:
- Use exchange stop-loss (not strategy stop)
- Set liquidation price alerts
- Never hold through high volatility events

## 🎯 Optimal Strategy for 25x Leverage

### Configuration

```python
# Ultra-Conservative Leveraged Setup
config = FilterConfig(
    min_confidence=0.75,      # Top 10% of predictions only
    min_movement_pct=6.0,     # Only huge moves
    use_roc_filter=True,      # Must have momentum
)

strategy = ProductionMEMStrategy(
    config=config,
    initial_capital=10000.0,
    position_size_pct=0.015   # 1.5% = $150 = $3,750 leveraged
)

# Risk limits
MAX_DAILY_LOSS = 200          # $200 = 2% of account
MAX_POSITION_RISK = 150       # $150 per trade
STOP_LOSS_PCT = 0.015         # 1.5% of entry price
```

### Expected Results

**Per Trade**:
- Position: $150 unleveraged → $3,750 leveraged
- 6% win: +$225 (2.25% account gain)
- 1.5% loss: -$56.25 (0.56% account loss)

**Per Month** (8-10 trades):
- Wins: 8 × $225 = +$1,800
- Losses: 2 × -$56 = -$112
- **Net: +$1,688 (+16.9% monthly)**
- **Annualized: ~650% return**

## 🚨 Final Warning

### Reality Check

**25x leverage means**:

---

## ✅ Recommended Starting Point

**For First Month**:
```python
# Ultra-conservative leveraged config
position_size = 0.01          # 1% of capital
min_confidence = 0.75         # 75% threshold
min_movement = 6.0            # 6% moves
stop_loss = 0.015             # 1.5% stop
max_daily_loss = 0.02         # 2% daily limit
leverage = 25                 # 25x leverage
```

**Expected**:
- 5-8 trades/month
- 12-18% monthly return
- Low wipeout risk
- Survivable losses

**After 3 months**:
- If profitable → can increase to 1.5-2% positions
- If breakeven → keep same settings
- If losing → reduce to 0.5% positions or stop leveraged trading

---

**Status**: ⚠️ **HIGH RISK - PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION**

**Recommendation**: Start with 1% positions, 1.5% stops, 75% confidence threshold

**Expected Return**: 15-25% monthly (if survive)

**Wipeout Risk**: Moderate with proper risk management, HIGH without

---

**Remember**: It's better to make 15% monthly and survive than to chase 100% and lose everything.
