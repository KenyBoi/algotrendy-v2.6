### 10. Pattern Discovery Engine

**How It Works:**
1. Analyze last 500 trades
2. Find common characteristics in winning trades
3. Create signature for each pattern (e.g., "momentum + RSI<40 + volume spike")
4. Calculate win rate for each signature
5. If WR ≥ 70% and count ≥ 5, create new strategy
6. Backtest new strategy on historical data
7. Deploy if validation passes
8. Monitor performance continuously

**Example Discovered Patterns:**
- `high_vol_reversal_v3`: 68% WR, 245 trades
- `momentum_rsi_combo`: 80% WR, 43 trades
- `macd_divergence_long`: 72% WR, 89 trades
- `volume_breakout_v2`: 55% WR, 156 trades (deprecated)

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Trend Following with Learning

**Scenario**: BTCUSDT shows strong upward momentum

**Without MEM:**
```
Signal: BUY (momentum strategy)
Confidence: 0.60
Position Size: 0.1 BTC (fixed)
Stop Loss: -2% (fixed)
Reasoning: "Momentum > threshold"
```

**With MEM:**
```
Signal: BUY (momentum + ML + memory enhanced)
Confidence: 0.78
Position Size: 0.12 BTC (increased - pattern has 80% WR)
Stop Loss: -1.3% (tightened - pattern reliable)
Reasoning: "Momentum confirmed by ML reversal prediction (78% conf).
            Pattern matches LearnedMomentumRSICombo (80% WR, 43 trades).
            Last 3 similar trades won with avg +1.2% gain.
            Risk: Low - volatility normal, liquidity excellent."
```

**Outcome**: +$720 gain (vs. +$600 without MEM) in 12 minutes

**Learning**: MEM logs this success and increases confidence in this pattern (80% → 81%)

---

### Use Case 2: Risk Reduction During Losing Streaks

**Scenario**: 3 consecutive losing trades detected

**MEM Response:**
```
ADAPTATION TRIGGERED: Performance degradation detected

Changes made:
1. Position size reduced: 0.12 BTC → 0.08 BTC (-33%)
2. Confidence threshold raised: 0.65 → 0.75
3. Risk per trade reduced: 2% → 1.5%
4. Stop loss tightened: -2% → -1.8%
5. Strategy preference: Switched to conservative learned patterns

Reasoning: "Win rate dropped to 42% over last 15 trades.
            Reducing risk until performance improves."

Result: Next 20 trades had 58% WR with reduced drawdown
```

---

### Use Case 3: Market Regime Adaptation

**Scenario**: Volatility suddenly doubles (e.g., major news event)

**MEM Response:**
```
MARKET REGIME CHANGE DETECTED

Old regime: Low volatility (0.8)
New regime: High volatility (2.2) - ALERT

Adaptations:
1. Position sizes reduced across the board (-40%)
2. Stop losses widened (+50% to avoid noise)
3. Profit targets increased (+30% to capture larger moves)
4. Switched to high-volatility learned strategies
5. Increased ML confidence threshold (0.65 → 0.75)

Active strategies:
- LearnedHighVolatilityReversal (68% WR in high vol)
- VolatilityBreakout_v4 (61% WR in high vol)
- Disabled: momentum_tight_stop (fails in high vol)

Performance: Maintained 60%+ WR despite regime change
Without adaptation: Estimated 35% WR (back-tested)
```

---

### Use Case 4: Broker Selection Optimization

**Scenario**: Need to trade ETHUSDT

**MEM Analysis:**
```
Symbol: ETHUSDT
Analyzing broker performance history...

Binance:
- Avg slippage: 0.06%
- Fill rate: 94%
- Best hours: 8-16 UTC
- Last 50 ETHUSDT trades: 58% WR

Bybit:
- Avg slippage: 0.04% (BETTER)
- Fill rate: 96% (BETTER)
- Best hours: 0-8 UTC
- Last 50 ETHUSDT trades: 65% WR (BETTER)

DECISION: Route to Bybit
Reasoning: "Historical data shows better execution + higher WR on Bybit for ETHUSDT.
            Expected improvement: +7% WR, -0.02% slippage ($20 saved per BTC)"
```
