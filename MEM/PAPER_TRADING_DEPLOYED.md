Connect to exchange testnet for real-time paper trading:

1. Get Bybit testnet API keys
2. Integrate with live price feed
3. Run for 2 weeks
4. Validate performance matches backtest

### Option 3: Go Live (After Validation)

3. Monitor daily for first month
4. Scale up if successful

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### This is Paper Trading
- ✅ No real money at risk
- ✅ Uses historical data
- ✅ Validates strategy logic
- ⚠️ Not affected by slippage or live market conditions

### Before Live Trading
You MUST:
1. Paper trade for minimum 2 weeks with live data
2. Validate 70%+ win rate continues
3. Test on multiple market conditions
4. Start with small capital (<$1,000)
5. Monitor closely for first month

### Risk Disclaimer
- Past performance ≠ future results
- Strategy may perform differently in live markets
- Always use proper risk management
- Never trade more than you can afford to lose
